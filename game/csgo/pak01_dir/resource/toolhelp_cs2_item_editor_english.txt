			<h2>How to Create a Pattern</h2>
			<p>Color images are typically stored in red, green and blue channels that combine additively to represent a large range of color values. For our patterns, we take advantage of this configuration to store three separate images. The final result is a bit bright, but don’t worry, what it looks like here isn’t how it’ll look on a weapon.</p>
			<br><br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/patterns_b.png' /><br>
			<span class=important><b><u>IMPORTANT!</u></b> Copy the opacity of each layer into the RGB channels of a new image. The base coat is not included.</span><br>
			<h2>Pattern Application Method</h2>
			<p>Hydrographic finishes are UV mapped, the pattern tiles over the weapon’s existing UVs. To relate that to a real-world application, imagine disassembling the weapon into parts before applying the finish.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/uv_map.png' />
			<h2>Color Application Process</h2>
			<p>The pattern is applied one layer at a time, starting with a base coat that covers all paintable areas of the weapon followed by the red, green, and blue channels in that order.</p>
			<br><br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/patterns_a.png' />
			<h2>Durability and Masking</h2>
			<p>On top of their RGB channels, Color textures have an additional, optional “alpha” channel. Hydrographic finishes allow paint masking and durability to be specified in the alpha channel.</p>

			<h2>How to Create a Pattern</h2>
			<p>Color images are typically stored in red, green and blue channels that combine additively to represent a large range of color values. For our patterns, we take advantage of this configuration to store three separate images. The final result is a bit bright, but don’t worry, what it looks like here isn’t how it’ll look on a weapon.</p>
			<br><br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/patterns_b.png' /><br>
			<span class=important><b><u>IMPORTANT!</u></b> Copy the opacity of each layer into the RGB channels of a new image. The base coat is not included.</span><br>
			<h2>Pattern Application Method</h2>
			<p>Spray-Paint finishes are applied using triplanar mapping. Think of it as spray painting though a stencil onto the sides, top, bottom, back and front of the weapon. The pattern blends across the surface normals.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/triplanar_map.png' />
			<h2>Color Application Process</h2>
			<p>The pattern is applied one layer at a time, starting with a base coat that covers all paintable areas of the weapon followed by the red, green, and blue channels in that order.</p>

			<h2>Physically Based Rendering</h2>
			<p>CS2 uses physically based rendering which requires weapon finishes to be authored within the effective PBR range for that material.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_a.png' />
			<p>For metallic finishes like Anodized Multicolored, Patina, and the metallic portions of Gunsmith, the effective RGB range is most likely between <b>180-250</b>. Values as low as <b>90</b> may be acceptable depending on the color's saturation.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_b.png' />
			<p>For non-metallic finishes, the effective reflectance range is between <b>55-220</b>. Albedo values outside of this range will not respond appropriately to in-game lighting conditions. Finishes using values outside the effective PBR range are unlikely to be selected from the workshop.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Checking Texture PBR</h2>
			<p>To check if your albedo texture is PBR safe open VConsole2(~) and enter \"mat_fullbright 10\" to enter Albedo mode highlighting any colors outside of PBR range.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/weapon_pbr.png' />
			<ul>
			<li><b style=\"color: #949bfe\">Blue</b> - Below the PBR threshold appearing too dark</li>
			<li><b style=\"color: #fe9494\">Red</b> - Above the PBR threshold appearing too bright</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>You can also access this by clicking the ConVar button in VConsole2 to open the ConVar Helper. In the \"csgo art\" page you can click the \"Albedo\" button to toggle \"mat_fullbright 10\"</p>

			<h2>How to Create a Pattern</h2>
			<p>Color images are typically stored in red, green and blue channels that combine additively to represent a large range of color values. For our patterns, we take advantage of this configuration to store three separate images. The final result is a bit bright, but don’t worry, what it looks like here isn’t how it’ll look on a weapon.</p>
			<br><br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/patterns_b.png' /><br>
			<span class=important><b><u>IMPORTANT!</u></b> Copy the opacity of each layer into the RGB channels of a new image. The base coat is not included.</span><br>
			<h2>Pattern Application Method</h2>
			<p>Anodized Multicolor finishes are applied using triplanar mapping. Think of it as spray painting though a stencil onto the sides, top, bottom, back and front of the weapon. The pattern blends across the surface normals.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/triplanar_map.png' />
			<h2>Color Application Process</h2>
			<p>The pattern is applied one layer at a time, starting with a base coat that covers all paintable areas of the weapon followed by the red, green, and blue channels in that order.</p>

			<h2>How to Create a Pattern</h2>
			<p>Color images are typically stored in red, green and blue channels that combine additively to represent a large range of color values. For our patterns, we take advantage of this configuration to store three separate images. The final result is a bit bright, but don’t worry, what it looks like here isn’t how it’ll look on a weapon.</p>
			<br><br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/patterns_b.png' /><br>
			<span class=important><b><u>IMPORTANT!</u></b> Copy the opacity of each layer into the RGB channels of a new image. The base coat is not included.</span><br>
			<h2>Pattern Application Method</h2>
			<p>Anodized Airbrushed finishes are applied using triplanar mapping. Think of it as spray painting though a stencil onto the sides, top, bottom, back and front of the weapon. The pattern blends across the surface normals.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/triplanar_map.png' />
			<h2>Color Application Process</h2>
			<p>The pattern is applied one layer at a time, starting with a base coat that covers all paintable areas of the weapon followed by the red, green, and blue channels in that order.</p>

			<h2>Texture Application Method</h2>
			<p>Custom Paint Job finishes simply tile the full-color texture over the weapon’s existing UVs. To relate that to a real-world application, imagine disassembling the weapon into parts before applying the finish.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/uv_map.png' />
						
			<h2>Physically Based Rendering</h2>
			<p>CS2 uses physically based rendering which requires weapon finishes to be authored within the effective PBR range for that material.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_a.png' />
			<p>For metallic finishes like Anodized Multicolored, Patina, and the metallic portions of Gunsmith, the effective RGB range is most likely between <b>180-250</b>. Values as low as <b>90</b> may be acceptable depending on the color's saturation.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_b.png' />
			<p>For non-metallic finishes, the effective reflectance range is between <b>55-220</b>. Albedo values outside of this range will not respond appropriately to in-game lighting conditions. Finishes using values outside the effective PBR range are unlikely to be selected from the workshop.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Checking Texture PBR</h2>
			<p>To check if your albedo texture is PBR safe open VConsole2(~) and enter \"mat_fullbright 10\" to enter Albedo mode highlighting any colors outside of PBR range.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/weapon_pbr.png' />
			<ul>
			<li><b style=\"color: #949bfe\">Blue</b> - Below the PBR threshold appearing too dark</li>
			<li><b style=\"color: #fe9494\">Red</b> - Above the PBR threshold appearing too bright</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>You can also access this by clicking the ConVar button in VConsole2 to open the ConVar Helper. In the \"csgo art\" page you can click the \"Albedo\" button to toggle \"mat_fullbright 10\"</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/albedo_toggle.png' />
			<br>
			<h2>Paint Masking and Durability:</h2>
			<p>On top of their RGB channels, Color textures have an additional, optional “alpha” channel. Custom Paint Job finishes allow paint masking and durability to be specified in the alpha channel.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Values around 196 in the alpha channel subtract from the refinishable areas of the weapon.</li>
			<li>Both 128 and 255 have no effect, so the finish wears using the default behavior in these areas.</li>
			<li>Values below 128 increase the durability of the finish. The darker the value, the more durable the paint.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/durability_cu.png' /><br>
			<p>Each finishable weapon uses a special texture to determine what parts should receive finish. This texture also influences how quickly the finish wears off different features of the weapon. The original, unfinished material underneath is called the substrate.</p>
			<br><br>
			<em>
			<u>When to use a pattern’s alpha channel:</u>
			<ul>
			<li>Your design requires more coverage than the default</li>
			<li>Your design requires more of the substrate to be revealed</li>
			<li>Important features of your design wear too quickly</li>
			<li>Important features of your design should never wear to the substrate</li>

			<h2>Texture Application Method</h2>
			<p>Patina finishes simply tile the texture over the weapon’s existing UVs. To relate that to a real-world application, imagine disassembling the weapon into parts before applying the finish.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/uv_map.png' />		
			<h2>Physically Based Rendering</h2>
			<p>CS2 uses physically based rendering which requires weapon finishes to be authored within the effective PBR range for that material.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_a.png' />
			<p>For metallic finishes like Anodized Multicolored, Patina, and the metallic portions of Gunsmith, the effective RGB range is most likely between <b>180-250</b>. Values as low as <b>90</b> may be acceptable depending on the color's saturation.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_b.png' />
			<p>For non-metallic finishes, the effective reflectance range is between <b>55-220</b>. Albedo values outside of this range will not respond appropriately to in-game lighting conditions. Finishes using values outside the effective PBR range are unlikely to be selected from the workshop.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Checking Texture PBR</h2>
			<p>To check if your albedo texture is PBR safe open VConsole2(~) and enter \"mat_fullbright 10\" to enter Albedo mode highlighting any colors outside of PBR range.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/weapon_pbr.png' />
			<ul>
			<li><b style=\"color: #949bfe\">Blue</b> - Below the PBR threshold appearing too dark</li>
			<li><b style=\"color: #fe9494\">Red</b> - Above the PBR threshold appearing too bright</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>You can also access this by clicking the ConVar button in VConsole2 to open the ConVar Helper. In the \"csgo art\" page you can click the \"Albedo\" button to toggle \"mat_fullbright 10\"</p>

			<h2>Paint Masking and Durability:</h2>
			<p>On top of their RGB channels, Color textures have an additional, optional “alpha” channel. Gunsmith finishes combine Patina and Custom Paint Job styles allowing paint masking and durability to be specified in the alpha channel differently depending on material type.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Areas of the weapon that are painted using the Custom Paint Job style allows paint masking and durability using the alpha channel in those areas.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Values around 196 in the alpha channel subtract from the refinishable areas of the weapon.</li>
			<li>Both 128 and 255 have no effect, so the finish wears using the default behavior in these areas.</li>
			<li>Values below 128 increase the durability of the finish. The darker the value, the more durable the paint.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/durability_gs.png' /><br>
			<p>Each finishable weapon uses a special texture to determine what parts should receive finish. This texture also influences how quickly the finish wears off different features of the weapon. The original, unfinished material underneath is called the substrate.</p>
			<br><br>
			<em>
			<u>When to use a pattern’s alpha channel:</u>
			<ul>
			<li>Your design requires more coverage than the default</li>
			<li>Your design requires more of the substrate to be revealed</li>
			<li>Important features of your design wear too quickly</li>
			<li>Important features of your design should never wear to the substrate</li>

			<h2>Texture Application Method</h2>
			<p>Custom Paint Job finishes simply tile the full-color texture over the weapon’s existing UVs. To relate that to a real-world application, imagine disassembling the weapon into parts before applying the finish.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/uv_map.png' />
						
			<h2>Physically Based Rendering</h2>
			<p>CS2 uses physically based rendering which requires weapon finishes to be authored within the effective PBR range for that material.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_a.png' />
			<p>For metallic finishes like Anodized Multicolored, Patina, and the metallic portions of Gunsmith, the effective RGB range is most likely between <b>180-250</b>. Values as low as <b>90</b> may be acceptable depending on the color's saturation.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_b.png' />
			<p>For non-metallic finishes, the effective reflectance range is between <b>55-220</b>. Albedo values outside of this range will not respond appropriately to in-game lighting conditions. Finishes using values outside the effective PBR range are unlikely to be selected from the workshop.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Checking Texture PBR</h2>
			<p>To check if your albedo texture is PBR safe open VConsole2(~) and enter \"mat_fullbright 10\" to enter Albedo mode highlighting any colors outside of PBR range.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/weapon_pbr.png' />
			<ul>
			<li><b style=\"color: #949bfe\">Blue</b> - Below the PBR threshold appearing too dark</li>
			<li><b style=\"color: #fe9494\">Red</b> - Above the PBR threshold appearing too bright</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>You can also access this by clicking the ConVar button in VConsole2 to open the ConVar Helper. In the \"csgo art\" page you can click the \"Albedo\" button to toggle \"mat_fullbright 10\"</p>

			<h2>Texture Application Method</h2>
			<p>Custom Paint Job finishes simply tile the full-color texture over the weapon’s existing UVs. To relate that to a real-world application, imagine disassembling the weapon into parts before applying the finish.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/uv_map.png' />
						
			<h2>Physically Based Rendering</h2>
			<p>CS2 uses physically based rendering which requires weapon finishes to be authored within the effective PBR range for that material.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_a.png' />
			<p>For metallic finishes like Anodized Multicolored, Patina, and the metallic portions of Gunsmith, the effective RGB range is most likely between <b>180-250</b>. Values as low as <b>90</b> may be acceptable depending on the color's saturation.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_b.png' />
			<p>For non-metallic finishes, the effective reflectance range is between <b>55-220</b>. Albedo values outside of this range will not respond appropriately to in-game lighting conditions. Finishes using values outside the effective PBR range are unlikely to be selected from the workshop.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Checking Texture PBR</h2>
			<p>To check if your albedo texture is PBR safe open VConsole2(~) and enter \"mat_fullbright 10\" to enter Albedo mode highlighting any colors outside of PBR range.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/weapon_pbr.png' />
			<ul>
			<li><b style=\"color: #949bfe\">Blue</b> - Below the PBR threshold appearing too dark</li>
			<li><b style=\"color: #fe9494\">Red</b> - Above the PBR threshold appearing too bright</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>You can also access this by clicking the ConVar button in VConsole2 to open the ConVar Helper. In the \"csgo art\" page you can click the \"Albedo\" button to toggle \"mat_fullbright 10\"</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/albedo_toggle.png' />
			<br>
			<h2>Paint Masking and Durability:</h2>
			<p>On top of their RGB channels, Color textures have an additional, optional “alpha” channel. Custom Paint Job finishes allow paint masking and durability to be specified in the alpha channel.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Values around 196 in the alpha channel subtract from the refinishable areas of the weapon.</li>
			<li>Both 128 and 255 have no effect, so the finish wears using the default behavior in these areas.</li>
			<li>Values below 128 increase the durability of the finish. The darker the value, the more durable the paint.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/durability_cu.png' /><br>
			<p>Each finishable weapon uses a special texture to determine what parts should receive finish. This texture also influences how quickly the finish wears off different features of the weapon. The original, unfinished material underneath is called the substrate.</p>
			<br><br>
			<em>
			<u>When to use a pattern’s alpha channel:</u>
			<ul>
			<li>Your design requires more coverage than the default</li>
			<li>Your design requires more of the substrate to be revealed</li>
			<li>Important features of your design wear too quickly</li>
			<li>Important features of your design should never wear to the substrate</li>
			</em>
			</ul>

			<h2>Texture Application Method</h2>
			<p>Gunsmith finishes simply tile the full-color texture over the weapon’s existing UVs. To relate that to a real-world application, imagine disassembling the weapon into parts before applying the finish.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/uv_map.png' />
			
			<h2>Physically Based Rendering</h2>
			<p>CS2 uses physically based rendering which requires weapon finishes to be authored within the effective PBR range for that material.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_a.png' />
			<p>For metallic finishes like Anodized Multicolored, Patina, and the metallic portions of Gunsmith, the effective RGB range is most likely between <b>180-250</b>. Values as low as <b>90</b> may be acceptable depending on the color's saturation.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_b.png' />
			<p>For non-metallic finishes, the effective reflectance range is between <b>55-220</b>. Albedo values outside of this range will not respond appropriately to in-game lighting conditions. Finishes using values outside the effective PBR range are unlikely to be selected from the workshop.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Checking Texture PBR</h2>
			<p>To check if your albedo texture is PBR safe open VConsole2(~) and enter \"mat_fullbright 10\" to enter Albedo mode highlighting any colors outside of PBR range.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/weapon_pbr.png' />
			<ul>
			<li><b style=\"color: #949bfe\">Blue</b> - Below the PBR threshold appearing too dark</li>
			<li><b style=\"color: #fe9494\">Red</b> - Above the PBR threshold appearing too bright</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>You can also access this by clicking the ConVar button in VConsole2 to open the ConVar Helper. In the \"csgo art\" page you can click the \"Albedo\" button to toggle \"mat_fullbright 10\"</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/albedo_toggle.png' />
			<br>
			<h2>Paint Masking and Durability:</h2>
			<p>On top of their RGB channels, Color textures have an additional, optional “alpha” channel. Gunsmith finishes combine Patina and Custom Paint Job styles allowing paint masking and durability to be specified in the alpha channel differently depending on material type.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Areas of the weapon that are painted using the Custom Paint Job style allows paint masking and durability using the alpha channel in those areas.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Values around 196 in the alpha channel subtract from the refinishable areas of the weapon.</li>
			<li>Both 128 and 255 have no effect, so the finish wears using the default behavior in these areas.</li>
			<li>Values below 128 increase the durability of the finish. The darker the value, the more durable the paint.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/durability_gs.png' /><br>
			<p>Each finishable weapon uses a special texture to determine what parts should receive finish. This texture also influences how quickly the finish wears off different features of the weapon. The original, unfinished material underneath is called the substrate.</p>
			<br><br>
			<em>
			<u>When to use a pattern’s alpha channel:</u>
			<ul>
			<li>Your design requires more coverage than the default</li>
			<li>Your design requires more of the substrate to be revealed</li>
			<li>Important features of your design wear too quickly</li>
			<li>Important features of your design should never wear to the substrate</li>
			</em>
			</ul>

			<h2>Texture Application Method</h2>
			<p>Custom Paint Job finishes simply tile the full-color texture over the weapon’s existing UVs. To relate that to a real-world application, imagine disassembling the weapon into parts before applying the finish.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/uv_map.png' />
						
			<h2>Physically Based Rendering</h2>
			<p>CS2 uses physically based rendering which requires weapon finishes to be authored within the effective PBR range for that material.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_a.png' />
			<p>For metallic finishes like Anodized Multicolored, Patina, and the metallic portions of Gunsmith, the effective RGB range is most likely between <b>180-250</b>. Values as low as <b>90</b> may be acceptable depending on the color's saturation.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_b.png' />
			<p>For non-metallic finishes, the effective reflectance range is between <b>55-220</b>. Albedo values outside of this range will not respond appropriately to in-game lighting conditions. Finishes using values outside the effective PBR range are unlikely to be selected from the workshop.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Checking Texture PBR</h2>
			<p>To check if your albedo texture is PBR safe open VConsole2(~) and enter \"mat_fullbright 10\" to enter Albedo mode highlighting any colors outside of PBR range.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/weapon_pbr.png' />
			<ul>
			<li><b style=\"color: #949bfe\">Blue</b> - Below the PBR threshold appearing too dark</li>
			<li><b style=\"color: #fe9494\">Red</b> - Above the PBR threshold appearing too bright</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>You can also access this by clicking the ConVar button in VConsole2 to open the ConVar Helper. In the \"csgo art\" page you can click the \"Albedo\" button to toggle \"mat_fullbright 10\"</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/albedo_toggle.png' />
			<br>
			<h2>Paint Masking and Durability:</h2>
			<p>On top of their RGB channels, Color textures have an additional, optional “alpha” channel. Custom Paint Job finishes allow paint masking and durability to be specified in the alpha channel.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Values around 196 in the alpha channel subtract from the refinishable areas of the weapon.</li>
			<li>Both 128 and 255 have no effect, so the finish wears using the default behavior in these areas.</li>
			<li>Values below 128 increase the durability of the finish. The darker the value, the more durable the paint.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/durability_cu.png' /><br>
			<p>Each finishable weapon uses a special texture to determine what parts should receive finish. This texture also influences how quickly the finish wears off different features of the weapon. The original, unfinished material underneath is called the substrate.</p>
			<br><br>
			<em>
			<u>When to use a pattern’s alpha channel:</u>
			<ul>
			<li>Your design requires more coverage than the default</li>
			<li>Your design requires more of the substrate to be revealed</li>
			<li>Important features of your design wear too quickly</li>
			<li>Important features of your design should never wear to the substrate</li>
			</em>
			</ul>

			<h2>Pattern Application Method</h2>
			<p>Hydrographic finishes are UV mapped, the pattern tiles over the weapon’s existing UVs. To relate that to a real-world application, imagine disassembling the weapon into parts before applying the finish.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/uv_map.png' />
			<h2>Color Application Process</h2>
			<p>The pattern is applied one layer at a time, starting with a base coat that covers all paintable areas of the weapon followed by the red, green, and blue channels in that order.</p>
			<br><br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/patterns_a.png' />
			<h2>Durability and Masking</h2>
			<p>On top of their RGB channels, Color textures have an additional, optional “alpha” channel. Hydrographic finishes allow paint masking and durability to be specified in the alpha channel.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Values around 196 in the alpha channel subtract from the refinishable areas of the weapon.</li>
			<li>Both 128 and 255 have no effect, so the finish wears using the default behavior in these areas.</li>
			<li>Values below 128 increase the durability of the finish. The darker the value, the more durable the paint.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/durability_hy.png' /><br>
			<p>Each finishable weapon uses a special texture to determine what parts should receive finish. This texture also influences how quickly the finish wears off different features of the weapon. The original, unfinished material underneath is called the substrate.</p>
			<br><br>
			<em>
			<u>When to use a pattern’s alpha channel:</u>
			<ul>
			<li>Your design requires more coverage than the default</li>
			<li>Your design requires more of the substrate to be revealed</li>
			<li>Important features of your design wear too quickly</li>
			<li>Important features of your design should never wear to the substrate</li>
			</em>
			</ul>

			<h2>Texture Application Method</h2>
			<p>Custom Paint Job finishes simply tile the full-color texture over the weapon’s existing UVs. To relate that to a real-world application, imagine disassembling the weapon into parts before applying the finish.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/uv_map.png' />
						
			<h2>Physically Based Rendering</h2>
			<p>CS2 uses physically based rendering which requires weapon finishes to be authored within the effective PBR range for that material.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_a.png' />
			<p>For metallic finishes like Anodized Multicolored, Patina, and the metallic portions of Gunsmith, the effective RGB range is most likely between <b>180-250</b>. Values as low as <b>90</b> may be acceptable depending on the color's saturation.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/color_b.png' />
			<p>For non-metallic finishes, the effective reflectance range is between <b>55-220</b>. Albedo values outside of this range will not respond appropriately to in-game lighting conditions. Finishes using values outside the effective PBR range are unlikely to be selected from the workshop.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Checking Texture PBR</h2>
			<p>To check if your albedo texture is PBR safe open VConsole2(~) and enter \"mat_fullbright 10\" to enter Albedo mode highlighting any colors outside of PBR range.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/weapon_pbr.png' />
			<ul>
			<li><b style=\"color: #949bfe\">Blue</b> - Below the PBR threshold appearing too dark</li>
			<li><b style=\"color: #fe9494\">Red</b> - Above the PBR threshold appearing too bright</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>You can also access this by clicking the ConVar button in VConsole2 to open the ConVar Helper. In the \"csgo art\" page you can click the \"Albedo\" button to toggle \"mat_fullbright 10\"</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/albedo_toggle.png' />
			<br>
			<h2>Paint Masking and Durability:</h2>
			<p>On top of their RGB channels, Color textures have an additional, optional “alpha” channel. Custom Paint Job finishes allow paint masking and durability to be specified in the alpha channel.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Values around 196 in the alpha channel subtract from the refinishable areas of the weapon.</li>
			<li>Both 128 and 255 have no effect, so the finish wears using the default behavior in these areas.</li>
			<li>Values below 128 increase the durability of the finish. The darker the value, the more durable the paint.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/durability_cu.png' /><br>
			<p>Each finishable weapon uses a special texture to determine what parts should receive finish. This texture also influences how quickly the finish wears off different features of the weapon. The original, unfinished material underneath is called the substrate.</p>
			<br><br>
			<em>
			<u>When to use a pattern’s alpha channel:</u>
			<ul>
			<li>Your design requires more coverage than the default</li>
			<li>Your design requires more of the substrate to be revealed</li>
			<li>Important features of your design wear too quickly</li>
			<li>Important features of your design should never wear to the substrate</li>
			</em>
			</ul>

			<h2>How to Create a Pattern</h2>
			<p>Color images are typically stored in red, green and blue channels that combine additively to represent a large range of color values. For our patterns, we take advantage of this configuration to store three separate images. The final result is a bit bright, but don’t worry, what it looks like here isn’t how it’ll look on a weapon.</p>
			<br><br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/patterns_b.png' /><br>
			<span class=important><b><u>IMPORTANT!</u></b> Copy the opacity of each layer into the RGB channels of a new image. The base coat is not included.</span><br>
			<h2>Pattern Application Method</h2>
			<p>Spray-Paint finishes are applied using triplanar mapping. Think of it as spray painting though a stencil onto the sides, top, bottom, back and front of the weapon. The pattern blends across the surface normals.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/triplanar_map.png' />
			<h2>Color Application Process</h2>
			<p>The pattern is applied one layer at a time, starting with a base coat that covers all paintable areas of the weapon followed by the red, green, and blue channels in that order.</p>

			<h2>How to Create a Pattern</h2>
			<p>Color images are typically stored in red, green and blue channels that combine additively to represent a large range of color values. For our patterns, we take advantage of this configuration to store three separate images. The final result is a bit bright, but don’t worry, what it looks like here isn’t how it’ll look on a weapon.</p>
			<br><br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/patterns_b.png' /><br>
			<span class=important><b><u>IMPORTANT!</u></b> Copy the opacity of each layer into the RGB channels of a new image. The base coat is not included.</span><br>
			<h2>Pattern Application Method</h2>
			<p>Spray-Paint finishes are applied using triplanar mapping. Think of it as spray painting though a stencil onto the sides, top, bottom, back and front of the weapon. The pattern blends across the surface normals.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/triplanar_map.png' />
			<h2>Color Application Process</h2>
			<p>The pattern is applied one layer at a time, starting with a base coat that covers all paintable areas of the weapon followed by the red, green, and blue channels in that order.</p>

			<p>For metallic finishes like Anodized Multicolored, Patina, and the metallic portions of Gunsmith, the effective RGB range is most likely between <b>180-250</b>. Values as low as <b>90</b> may be acceptable depending on the color's saturation.</p>

			<p>For foil stickers the effective RGB range is most likely between <b>180-250</b>. Values as low as <b>90</b> may be acceptable depending on the color's saturation.</p>

			<h2>Solid Color Style:</h2>
			<p>Individual components of the weapon are painted with up to four unique colors before reassembly.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/comp_solid.png' />

			<h2>Spray-Paint Style</h2>
			<p>The weapon is spray-painted with multiple coats through stencil patterns.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/comp_spray.png' />

			<h2>Hydrographic Style</h2>
			<p>Disassembled weapon parts are lowered through a floating hydrographic film on the surface of a water tank. The film adheres to the primed weapon parts, covering the surface with a pattern.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/comp_hydrographic.png' />

			<h2>Anodized Style</h2>
			<p>Many common firearms materials cannot be anodized. Instead the effect is often mimicked by applying a colored candy coat over a chrome base.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/comp_anodized.png' />

			<h2>Anodized Multicolored Style</h2>
			<p>In this style, the candy coat may be applied in a multicolored pattern. In the real world, methods could include silk-screening or adherable stencils.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/comp_anodized_multi.png' />

			<h2>Anodized Airbrushed Style</h2>
			<p>This style emulates applying the candy coat via freehand airbrushing.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/comp_anodized_airbrush.png' />

			<h2>Patina Style</h2>
			<p>A patina is a chemical reaction that forms a non-reactive, hardened shell over metallic parts. Real-life weapon patinas include case hardening, cold bluing, and acid forced patinas.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/comp_patina.png' />

			<h2>Custom Paint Style</h2>
			<p>This style enables extremely customized looks in a full range of colors.</p>
			<br>
			<img src='game:tools/cs2_item_editor/comp_custom.png' />

			<h2>Gunsmith Style</h2>
			<p>This style uses a combination of patina and custom paint styles.</p>
